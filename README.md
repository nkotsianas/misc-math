After not finding a decent way to calculate the inverse of the sinc function, I wrote a short spline interpolation, with tolerance values.

A program (in both Python and Matlab) to take an image of a plot and covert it to indicidual data points (pixel-by-pixel). Python does not vectorize the image, so the Matlab runs much faster.

Program to compute the iteration length (until divergence) in the Mandelbrot sequence for an arbitrary size input of c, in the complex plane.
